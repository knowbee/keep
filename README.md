    Your personal shell command keeper

## Why?

Keep solves the hustle of forgeting shell commands and having to always google/stackoverflow them wasting your precious time ðŸ˜‰

## Features

- Save a new command with a description
- Search the saved commands
- Use `keep --sync` and `keep --fetch` to sync the commands between your keep account and other computers.

**ProTip : Save the commands you usually forget in a database and sync it with your local machine.**
